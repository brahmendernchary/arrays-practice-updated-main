// Q1. What are React Hooks?
// Answer 1: React Hooks are a feature in React that allows developers to use state and other React features without writing a class component. Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" the React state and lifecycle methods from a functional component.

// Q2. What are the benefits of using React Hooks?
// Answer 2: Some benefits of using React Hooks are:

// It allows for simpler and cleaner code.
// Hooks make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components.
// It allows developers to use state and other React features without writing a class component, which simplifies the component's structure.
// It makes testing components easier because it is easier to test a function than a class.
// It simplifies the management of component state and side effects.
// Q3. What is the difference between a class component and a functional component with hooks?
// Answer 3: The main difference between a class component and a functional component with hooks is that a class component uses a "this" keyword to access its properties and methods, while a functional component uses function arguments and hooks. In a class component, state and lifecycle methods are declared inside the class, while in a functional component with hooks, state and lifecycle methods are declared using hooks.

// Q4. What are the rules of Hooks in React?
// Answer 4: The rules of Hooks in React are:

// Hooks should only be used at the top level of the functional component or custom hook.

// Hooks should only be called from within the React function component or a custom hook.

// Hooks should not be called conditionally.

// Hooks should always be called in the same order.

// Q5. What is the useState() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 5: The useState() hook is a function that returns an array containing two elements: the current state and a function to update the state. The useState() hook is used to add state to a functional component. Here is an example:

import React, { useState } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Q6. What is the useEffect() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 6: The useEffect() hook is a function that is called after every render of a functional component. The useEffect() hook is used to handle side effects, such as updating the document title, fetching data from an API, or subscribing to a WebSocket. Here is an example:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Q7. What is the useContext() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 7: The useContext() hook is a function that allows developers to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. The useContext() hook is used to consume a context that has been created by a parent component. Here is an example:

import React, { useContext } from "react";

import MyContext from "./MyContext";

function MyComponent() {
  const { username } = useContext(MyContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome, {username}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Q8. What is the useReducer() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 8: The useReducer() hook is used for managing complex state logic in React applications. It is an alternative to the useState() hook and is generally used when the state has multiple sub-values, or when the next state depends on the previous state. It accepts a reducer function and an initial state, and returns the current state and a dispatch function to update the state. The reducer function takes the current state and an action object as arguments and returns a new state.

// Here's an example of useReducer() hook usage:

import React, { useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };

    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };

    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// export default Counter;

// Q9. What is the useCallback() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 9: The useCallback() hook is used to optimize performance in React applications by memoizing a function so that it's not recreated on every render, unless its dependencies change. It's commonly used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that receive a function prop.

// Here's an example of useCallback() hook usage:

import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

import Child from "./Child";

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />

      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// export default Parent;

// Q10. What is the useMemo() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 10: The useMemo() hook is used to memoize expensive computations in React applications so that they're not unnecessarily recalculated on every render. It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments, and returns a memoized value.

// Here's an example of useMemo() hook usage:

import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";

function Parent() {
  const [count1, setCount1] = useState(0);

  const [count2, setCount2] = useState(0);

  const result = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Expensive computation");

    return count1 + count2;
  }, [count1, count2]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count 1: {count1}</p>

      <button onClick={() => setCount1(count1 + 1)}>Increment 1</button>

      <p>Count 2: {count2}</p>

      <button onClick={() => setCount2(count2 + 1)}>Increment 2</button>

      <p>Result: {result}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// export default Parent;

// In the above example, the result variable is memoized using useMemo() with count1 and count2 as dependencies. The expensive computation (console.log) is only executed when count1 or count2 changes.

// Q11. What is the useRef() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 11: The useRef() hook returns a mutable ref object which can hold a value in its .current property. This hook is used to access the DOM nodes or values that persist between the renders.

// The following code demonstrates how to use the useRef() hook in React:

import { useRef } from "react";

function ExampleComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />

      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}

// Q12. What is the useLayoutEffect() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 12: The useLayoutEffect() hook is similar to the useEffect() hook, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. This means that it can be used to manipulate the DOM immediately after a component has rendered. This can be useful in certain cases when you need to perform some layout calculations or measure the size of a component.

// The following code demonstrates how to use the useLayoutEffect() hook in React:

import { useLayoutEffect, useState } from "react";

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

    handleResize();

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>Window width: {width}px</div>;
}

// Q13. What is the useImperativeHandle() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 13:

// The useImperativeHandle() hook is used to expose certain methods or properties of a child component to its parent component. This is useful when you need to access certain functionality of a child component imperatively, i.e., by calling its methods directly.

// The following code demonstrates how to use the useImperativeHandle() hook in React:

import { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle, useRef } from "react";

const ChildComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focusInput: () => {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    },
  }));

  return <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />;
});

function ParentComponent() {
  const childRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    childRef.current.focusInput();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <ChildComponent ref={childRef} />

      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}

// Q14. What is the useDebugValue() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 14:

// The useDebugValue() hook is used to display some debug information about a value in the React DevTools. This can be useful when you need to inspect the state of a component or a custom hook during development.

// The following code demonstrates how to use the useDebugValue() hook in React:

import { useDebugValue, useState } from "react";

function useToggle(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  useDebugValue(value ? "on" : "off");

  function toggle() {
    setValue(!value);
  }

  return [value, toggle];
}

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [isOn, toggle] = useToggle(false);

  return (
    <>
      <div>Value: {isOn ? "on" : "off"}</div>

      <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
    </>
  );
}

// Q15. How do you create a custom hook in React?
// Answer 15: How do you create a custom hook in React?

// A custom hook is a reusable function that contains some stateful logic and can be used across multiple components in a React application. Custom hooks are created by defining a function that uses one or more of the existing built-in hooks, or even other custom hooks. To create a custom hook, simply define a function starting with the "use" prefix, and use the built-in hooks inside it. Here is an example of a custom hook that uses the useState() hook:

import { useState } from "react";

function useCounter(initialValue) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  function decrement() {
    setCount(count - 1);
  }

  return { count, increment, decrement };
}

// In this example, we define a custom hook called useCounter() that takes an initialValue parameter and returns an object containing the current count value, and two functions to increment and decrement the count.

// Q16. How can you optimize the performance of a React component using hooks?
// Answer 16: How can you optimize the performance of a React component using hooks?

// There are several ways to optimize the performance of a React component using hooks:

// Memoize expensive calculations using the useMemo() hook. By memoizing a value, you can ensure that it is only computed when it is needed, rather than on every render.
// Use the useCallback() hook to memoize callback functions. This can prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that depend on the callback function.
// Use the useReducer() hook to manage complex state. This can be more performant than using the useState() hook for complex state that requires multiple updates.
// Use the useContext() hook to avoid prop drilling. This can simplify your code and make it more performant by passing data directly to components that need it, without having to pass it down through multiple levels of parent components.
// Use the useLayoutEffect() hook to perform synchronous updates. This can be useful for updating the DOM synchronously, rather than asynchronously.
// Q17. What is the difference between useMemo() and useCallback() hooks?
// Answer 17: What is the difference between useMemo() and useCallback() hooks?

// The useMemo() and useCallback() hooks are similar in that they both memoize a value to prevent unnecessary re-renders of a component. However, they differ in what they memoize:

// useMemo() memoizes a computed value, such as the result of an expensive calculation.
// useCallback() memoizes a callback function, such as an event handler or a function passed down to a child component.
// In other words, useMemo() is used to memoize a value, while useCallback() is used to memoize a function.

// Q18. What is the difference between useEffect() and useLayoutEffect() hooks?
// Answer 18: What is the difference between useEffect() and useLayoutEffect() hooks?

// The useEffect() and useLayoutEffect() hooks are similar in that they both allow you to perform side effects in a function component. However, they differ in when they are executed:

// useEffect() is executed asynchronously, after the component has been rendered and the DOM has been updated.
// useLayoutEffect() is executed synchronously, before the component has been rendered and the DOM has been updated.
// This means that useLayoutEffect() can be used for performing DOM manipulations that need to be synchronous, such as measuring the size of an element, while useEffect() should be used for performing side effects that do not require synchronous updates.

// Q19. How can you handle component cleanup in React using hooks?
// Answer 19: In React, you can handle component cleanup using the useEffect() hook. The useEffect() hook takes a cleanup function as a second argument that is called when the component unmounts. You can use this function to clean up any resources or subscriptions created by the component during its lifecycle.

// Q20. What is the useState() hook equivalent in class components?
// Answer 20: In class components, the equivalent of the useState() hook is the state property and the setState() method. You can declare the initial state in the constructor and update it using the setState() method.

// Example:

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>

        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Q21. How can you test a component that uses hooks in React?
// Answer 21: You can test a component that uses hooks in React using testing libraries such as React Testing Library or Enzyme. You can render the component and simulate user interactions to test its behavior.

// Example using React Testing Library:

import { render, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";

import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

test("clicking button increments count", () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);

  const button = getByText("Click me");

  fireEvent.click(button);

  const count = getByText("You clicked 1 times");

  expect(count).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Q22. What are the limitations of using hooks in React?
// Answer 22: While React Hooks provide a powerful way to build reusable and stateful logic for components, they do come with some limitations:

// Hooks are only available in React 16.8 or higher versions.
// It can be harder to read and understand code that uses hooks, especially for developers who are new to React.
// Developers must be careful to follow the rules of Hooks, such as only calling them at the top level of a function component, and not calling them conditionally.
// There can be some overhead with using hooks, as each call to a hook creates a new closure and state object.
// Some React lifecycle methods, such as shouldComponentUpdate(), componentWillReceiveProps(), and getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(), do not have direct equivalents in hooks.
// Q23. How can you handle errors in a React component using hooks?
// Answer 23: In React, you can handle errors in a component using the Error Boundary concept. You can wrap your component with an Error Boundary component and handle the error using componentDidCatch() lifecycle method. With hooks, you can create an Error Boundary component as a custom hook, and use it wherever you need it.

// Here's an example of how to create an Error Boundary hook in React:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useErrorBoundary() {
  const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleError() {
      setHasError(true);
    }

    window.addEventListener("error", handleError);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("error", handleError);
    };
  }, []);

  return hasError;
}

// You can then use this hook in any component that needs to handle errors:

function MyComponent() {
  const hasError = useErrorBoundary();

  if (hasError) {
    return <div>Something went wrong.</div>;
  }

  return <div>Render the component normally.</div>;
}

// Q24. What is the useMutation() hook and how is it used in Apollo Client?
// Answer 24:

// The useMutation() hook is part of the Apollo Client library, which is a popular GraphQL client for React applications. The useMutation() hook allows you to execute a mutation against your GraphQL server and update your local cache with the results.

// Here's an example of how to use the useMutation() hook in Apollo Client:

import { useMutation } from "@apollo/client";

import { gql } from "@apollo/client";

const ADD_TODO = gql`
  mutation AddTodo($text: String!) {
    addTodo(text: $text) {
      id

      text

      completed
    }
  }
`;

function AddTodo() {
  const [addTodo, { data }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    const text = e.target.elements[0].value;

    addTodo({ variables: { text } });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Add Todo" />

        <button type="submit">Add</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

// Q25. What is the useQuery() hook and how is it used in Apollo Client?
// Answer 25: The useQuery() hook is a part of the Apollo Client library and is used to fetch data from a GraphQL API. It takes a GraphQL query as an argument and returns an object that contains the loading state of the query, the data returned by the query, and any error that may have occurred during the query.

// Here is an example of how the useQuery() hook can be used in Apollo Client:

import { useQuery, gql } from "@apollo/client";

const GET_USERS = gql`
  query {
    users {
      id

      name

      email
    }
  }
`;

function UserList() {
  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(GET_USERS);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>
          {user.name} ({user.email})
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// In the above example, we use the useQuery() hook to fetch a list of users from a GraphQL API. The GET_USERS constant defines the GraphQL query that we want to run. The useQuery() hook is then called with this query, and it returns an object that contains the loading state, the data returned by the query, and any error that may have occurred. We can then use this data to render the list of users in our component.

// Q26. How can you handle server-side rendering with React and hooks?
// Answer 26: To handle server-side rendering with React and hooks, you can use the same technique used with class components, which is to use the renderToString method provided by the ReactDOMServer library. You can use the same server-side data fetching techniques with hooks that you use with class components.

// Q27. What is the useInterval() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 27:

// The useInterval() hook is used to run a function at a specific interval. It takes two arguments: a function to run and the interval time in milliseconds. Here is an example of how to use the useInterval() hook:

import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

function useInterval(callback, delay) {
  const savedCallback = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    savedCallback.current = callback;
  }, [callback]);

  useEffect(() => {
    function tick() {
      savedCallback.current();
    }

    if (delay !== null) {
      let id = setInterval(tick, delay);

      return () => clearInterval(id);
    }
  }, [delay]);
}

function Component() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, 1000);

  return <div>{count}</div>;
}

// Q28. How can you integrate third-party libraries with React and hooks?
// Answer 28: To integrate third-party libraries with React and hooks, you can follow the same process as you would with class components. You can use lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount() to initialize and clean up the library, respectively. You can also use useEffect() to handle the initialization and cleanup of the library. Here is an example of how to integrate the Moment.js library with React using hooks:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

import moment from "moment";

function Component() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(moment());

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setDate(moment());
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>{date.format("MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a")}</div>;
}

// Q29. How can you use the useLayoutEffect() hook for animations in React?
// Answer 29: The useLayoutEffect() hook can be used for animations in React by synchronously updating the DOM before the browser has a chance to paint. This can help prevent flickering and improve the smoothness of animations. Here is an example of how to use the useLayoutEffect() hook for animations:

import React, { useState, useLayoutEffect } from "react";

function Component() {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const div = document.querySelector(".animate");

    const { height: newHeight } = div.getBoundingClientRect();

    setHeight(newHeight);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="animate" style={{ height: "100px" }} />

      <div style={{ height: `${height}px` }}>Animating height</div>
    </div>
  );
}

// Q30. What is the useContext() hook equivalent in class components?
// Answer 30:

// The useContext() hook is used to consume context in a functional component. In class components, the equivalent method is to use the static contextType property to consume context.

// Here is an example:

import React from "react";

import MyContext from "./MyContext";

class MyClassComponent extends React.Component {
  static contextType = MyContext;

  render() {
    const { value } = this.context;

    return (
      <div>
        <p>Value from context: {value}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// In the example above, the MyClassComponent uses the static contextType property to consume the MyContext. The value from the context is accessed using this.context.

// Q31. How can you handle user authentication in a React application using hooks?
// Answer 31: You can handle user authentication in a React application using hooks by using the useContext and useState hooks to create an authentication context. The authentication context can contain a boolean value that determines whether the user is authenticated or not, and a function that updates the value of the boolean when the user logs in or logs out.

// For example, you can create an AuthContext using the following code:

import React from "react";

import MyContext from "./MyContext";

class MyClassComponent extends React.Component {
  static contextType = MyContext;

  render() {
    const { value } = this.context;

    return (
      <div>
        <p>Value from context: {value}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// In the above code, we are creating an AuthContext using the createContext hook. We are also creating a useAuth hook that returns the authentication context. We are then creating an AuthProvider component that sets the initial state of the authenticated value to false, and also defines the login and logout functions that update the authenticated value accordingly. We are then wrapping our app with the AuthProvider component so that the authentication context is available to all child components.

// To use the AuthContext in a component, we can use the useAuth hook as follows:

import { useAuth } from "./AuthContext";

function MyComponent() {
  const { authenticated, login, logout } = useAuth();

  return (
    <div>
      {authenticated ? (
        <p>User is authenticated</p>
      ) : (
        <p>User is not authenticated</p>
      )}

      <button onClick={login}>Login</button>

      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// In the above code, we are using the useAuth hook to get access to the authenticated, login, and logout values from the authentication context. We are then rendering a message to the user based on whether they are authenticated or not, and also rendering Login and Logout buttons that call the login and logout functions respectively.

// Q32. What is the useInView() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 32: The useInView hook is a React hook that allows you to detect whether a particular element is in the viewport or not. This is useful when you want to trigger animations or other effects when an element becomes visible on the screen.

// To use the useInView hook, you need to install the react-intersection-observer package. You can then import the useInView hook from the package and use it in your component as follows:

import { useInView } from "react-intersection-observer";

function MyComponent() {
  const { ref, inView } = useInView();

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      {inView ? <p>Element is in view</p> : <p>Element is not in view</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

// In the above code, we are using the useInView hook to get access to the ref and inView values. We are then attaching the ref to a div element and using the inView value to render a message to the user based on whether the element is in view or not.

// Q33. What is the useDebounce() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 33: The useDebounce() hook is a custom hook that can be used to debounce a value in a React component. It takes two arguments - the value that needs to be debounced and the delay time in milliseconds.

// Here's an example of how to use the useDebounce() hook:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    };
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  const debouncedValue = useDebounce(inputValue, 500);

  function handleChange(event) {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleChange} />

      <p>Debounced value: {debouncedValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// In this example, the useDebounce() hook is used to debounce the input value of a text input field. The debouncedValue is updated after a delay of 500 milliseconds from the last time the inputValue was updated.

// Q34. What is the usePrevious() hook and how is it used?
// Answer 34: The usePrevious hook is a custom hook that allows us to keep track of the previous value of a state or prop in a functional component. It can be used to compare the previous value with the current value and take necessary actions based on the changes.

// Here's an example of how to implement the usePrevious hook:

import { useRef, useEffect } from "react";

function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value;
  }, [value]);

  return ref.current;
}

// Usage

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const prevCount = usePrevious(count);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current count: {count}</p>

      <p>Previous count: {prevCount}</p>

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// In this example, we create a custom hook called usePrevious that takes a value as a parameter and returns the previous value. We use the useRef hook to create a mutable ref that holds the previous value. In the useEffect hook, we update the ref's value to the current value whenever the value changes. Finally, we return the ref's current value as the previous value.

// In the MyComponent function, we use the usePrevious hook to keep track of the previous value of the count state. We display the current count, previous count, and a button to increase the count. Whenever the count changes, the useEffect hook updates the ref's value to the current count, and the usePrevious hook returns the previous count.

// Q35. How can you use the useSWR() hook for data fetching in React?
// Answer 35: The useSWR() hook is a data fetching library for React. It is used to handle the client-side data fetching of the React component. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API to fetch data from a server and handle its state.

// To use useSWR(), you first need to install the swr package by running the following command:

// npm install swr

// Then, you can use the useSWR() hook in your React component like this:

import useSWR from "swr";

function MyComponent() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR("/api/data", fetch);

  if (error) return <div>Error loading data</div>;

  if (!data) return <div>Loading data...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

// In the code above, we first import the useSWR() hook from the swr package. Then, we use it in our MyComponent function by passing the URL we want to fetch and the fetch function as arguments.

// The useSWR() hook returns an object with two properties: data and error. If the data is still being fetched, the data property will be null. If there is an error while fetching the data, the error property will be set to the error message.

// In the example above, we handle both the error and data properties by displaying an error message or loading indicator respectively. If the data is successfully fetched, we map over the data and render it to the screen.

// Overall, the useSWR() hook is a great way to handle data fetching in your React components, especially when it comes to handling the state and error handling.
// What are React Hooks?
// React Hooks are functions that allow developers to use features such as state and lifecycle methods in functional components. They make it possible for a function component to have similar capabilities to class components, without the need for writing class components. Hooks can also be used to share logic and data between different components. Essentially, React Hooks allow functional components to act like class components and manipulate variables, call functions from external sources, and generally control the flow of the application. Hooks are easy to use and help developers to keep the codebase uncluttered; the same logic can be shared among the components without making them overly complex.

// What Are The Advantages of react hooks?
// React Hooks offer a range of advantages over traditional class-based components, such as improved code readability and reusability. Firstly, they allow developers to use state and lifecycle methods in functional components, eliminating the need to switch between class and function components. Secondly, they enable sharing of logic and data between components, making it easier to manage the codebase. Thirdly, through the use of hooks, the application's flow is more easily controlled, allowing for the creation of complex yet unified applications. Finally, hooks keep the codebase clean by enabling the same logic to be utilized for different components without making them overly complicated. Ultimately, React Hooks make it possible for developers to write powerful and scalable applications with fewer lines of code, making for an efficient and enjoyable development experience.

// What are the benefits of using Custom Hooks?
// Custom Hooks are beneficial because they can be used to write functions that are reusable across different components in React. They provide a way to hook into React state and lifecycle behaviour from within a function component. Hooks allow developers to build complex applications with small, contained, decoupled code. With Custom Hooks, it is easier to share logic among components and break down logic into smaller pieces more easily. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to read for other developers. It also helps in developing programs that are more flexible, as parameters and options can be passed through the Custom Hook to meet your specific needs for each situation, thereby reducing the amount of code you need to write. Custom Hooks enable developers to use all the features of React without needing to create class components. By using Custom Hooks, you can take advantage of the built-in hooks provided by React, such as useState and useEffect. This helps developers to focus on the code they need to write, and helps them achieve better performance in the long term. Furthermore, Custom Hooks are a great way to enforce good software design principles such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). By breaking down code into smaller functions, it becomes easier to test, debug, and refactor your code. This ensures a high level of maintainability and reliability across your application. In short, Custom Hooks are an easy way to add more flexibility and maintainability to your React applications, while still taking advantage of the features provided by React.

// Can you give an example of a simple Custom React Hook?
// Sure, here is an example of a simple Custom React Hook that takes in two parameters: a counter and a limit. The hook will increment the counter by one every time it's called, and limit how many times it can be called before it reaches the given limit.
// // custom hook example
const useCounterHook = (counter, limit) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(counter);

  // increment counter every time hook is invoked
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);

  // if counter is greater than or equal to limit return
  // the number of times hook has been invoked
  const getTimesInvoked = () => (count >= limit ? count : null);

  return { increment, getTimesInvoked };
};

// // example usage in component
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const { increment, getTimesInvoked } = useCounterHook(0, 3);

  // call hook 3 times before stopping
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!getTimesInvoked()) {
      increment();
    }
  }, [increment, getTimesInvoked]);

  return <div>Example Component</div>;
};
// </div>

// Do two components that use the same Hook have their own separate state?
// Yes, two components that use the same Hook will have their own separate state. This is because each component can receive its own individualized state from the Hook, rather than a centralized shared state. The code snippet below shows how two components can use the same Hook but still maintain their own individualized states.
const someHook = () => {
  const [state1, setState1] = React.useState(0);
  const [state2, setState2] = React.useState(0);

  return [state1, setState1, state2, setState2];
};

const ComponentA = () => {
  const [state1, setState1, ,] = useHook();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Component A state1 value: {state1}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setState1(state1 + 1)}>Increase state1</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const ComponentB = () => {
  const [, , state2, setState2] = useHook();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Component B state2 value: {state2}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setState2(state2 + 1)}>Increase state2</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// How is useState different from useRef in React Hooks?
// useState and useRef are two React Hooks that can be used to set state in a functional component. The primary difference between these two is that useState is used to manage state values that are changed frequently and are tied to components, while useRef is used to store values that do not change often, such as references. The code snippet below shows an example of how useState and useRef can be used in the same component:
const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const countRef = React.useRef(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You have clicked  times`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* <button>{count: {count} setCount(count + 1)}>Increase Count</button> */}
      <button onClick={() => countRef.current++}>
        Increase Reference Count
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
// As seen above, when the "Increase Count" button is pressed, the component will update its count state using the useState hook, while when the "Increase Reference Count" button is pressed, the component will update its count reference using the useRef hook.

// How do React Hooks help a developer write code?
// React Hooks are a great way for developers to write cleaner and more concise code. With hooks, developers can use features such as state and effects without having to create classes or use class-based components. This means they can avoid the "wrapper hell" sometimes caused by excessive nesting of components and instead use simple, straightforward functions that can quickly be used to add features to an app. For example, instead of writing a class component with logic for setting state, a developer could take advantage of useState hook to do the same thing in fewer lines of code:
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(count + 1);
};

return (
  <div>
    <p>You have clicked {count} times</p>
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Increase Count</button>
  </div>
);

// How do React Hooks help a developer write code?
// React Hooks help developers write clean and maintainable code by allowing them to use functions instead of classes for state management. With React Hooks, developers can write code in a functional and declarative style, where the logic and data are all contained within individual functions. This makes it easier to debug and reason about the code, and helps keep the project codebase organized. Using the useState hook, for example, developers can manage their state without having to use a class-based component. Here's an example of how to use useState: const [myValue, setMyValue] = useState("") With this code, we are using useState to declare a state variable called myValue and create a function called setMyValue that will be used to update the value of myValue. When myValue is updated, the component will automatically re-render, making it easier to keep track of the state updates. In summary, React Hooks make writing code simpler, more organized, and less error prone. By allowing developers to write code in a functional style, React Hooks let developers focus on the logic and data, not the structure and complexity of classes.

// What role does componentWillMount() play in React Hooks?
// In React Hooks, componentWillMount() has been replaced by the useEffect() hook. The useEffect() hook allows developers to execute some logic when a component has been mounted. This helps to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of components which can cause performance issues. Here's an example of how to use useEffect():
useEffect(() => {
  //call API
}, []);
// In this example, the useEffect() hook will only be called once when the component is first mounted. This prevents unnecessary API calls and helps with performance. The useEffect() hook provides more flexibility than componentWillMount() as it can be used to execute any kind of logic, not just API calls. Additionally, the useEffect() hook can be used to monitor the changes in state and props or execute cleanup logic, whereas componentWillMount() is limited to only performing one-time logic when the component is mounted. To summarize, the useEffect() hook has replaced the componentWillMount() method in React Hooks and provides greater flexibility for developers. It allows them to execute any kind of logic when a component is mounted, including monitoring state and props changes, executing clean up logic, and more.

// What is the purpose of the useCallback hook?
// The useCallback hook is a React hook that allows you to create a memoized callback. A memoized callback is a type of function that takes an argument and creates a cached version of the result of the first call to the function. This cached version can then be re-used for subsequent function calls with the same argument. This is useful in many situations where you want to avoid extra computation, such as rendering components or re-running expensive calculations. By using the useCallback hook, you can store the cached results and make sure that your components aren't unnecessarily re-rendered or re-calculated. Here is an example of how to use the useCallback hook:
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);

  const memoizedCallback = React.useCallback(
    (newValue) => {
      setValue(newValue);
    },
    [setValue]
  );

  // ... other component code here

  return <MyOtherComponent onChange={memoizedCallback} />;
};
// In this example, the useCallback hook is used to create a memoized callback called memoizedCallback. This memoized callback is passed to MyOtherComponent as the onChange handler. This ensures that the function is only created once for the component and that it will not be re-created every time the component is rendered. This helps to ensure that the component's performance is optimized and that unnecessary processing is avoided.

// What is the purpose of the useMemo hook?
// The useMemo hook is a React hook that allows you to create a memoized version of a value or function. A memoized version of a value is a cached version of the result of the original calculation, which can then be used for subsequent calculations with the same parameters. This is useful in many situations where you want to avoid extra computation, such as rendering components or running expensive calculations. By using the useMemo hook, you can store the cached results and make sure that your components aren't unnecessarily re-rendered or re-calculated. This can help improve your application's performance significantly, especially when dealing with large datasets or deeply nested data. Here is an example of how to use the useMemo hook:
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);

  const expensiveValueFn = React.useMemo(() => {
    // ... do expensive calculation
    return value + 1;
  }, [value]);

  // ... other component code here

  return <MyOtherComponent value={expensiveValueFn} />;
};
// In this example, the useMemo hook is used to create a memoized version of the expensiveValueFn function. This ensures that the function is only called once for the component and that it will not be re-calculated every time the component is rendered. This helps to ensure that the component's performance is optimized and that unnecessary processing is avoided.

// What is the purpose of useEffect in React Hooks?
// The useEffect React hook allows you to perform side effects such as data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and subscribing to events in function components. It is similar to the componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount lifecycle methods in class components. By using the useEffect hook, you can ensure that side effects are only run when necessary and that they're not unnecessarily triggered by changes that don't actually need them. This helps to make sure that your application's performance is optimized. Here is an example of how to use the useEffect hook:
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // ... run side effects here
    console.log(`value changed to `);
  }, [value]); // only run effect if value changes

  // ... other component code here

  return <MyOtherComponent value={value} onChange={setValue} />;
};
// In this example, the useEffect hook is used to create a side effect that logs a message to the console whenever the value changes. This ensures that the side effect will only be triggered when necessary, saving unnecessary processing and improving application performance
